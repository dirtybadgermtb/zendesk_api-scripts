# Zendesk Automation Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts designed to automate and streamline tasks within Zendesk. These scripts utilize the Zendesk API to perform various operations, making it easier to manage tickets, users, and other administrative functions.

## Problem Statement

Aggregating individual files using Zendesk Postman libraries was problematic, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. These scripts were designed to solve this issue by efficiently populating thousands of records into single files, simplifying data management and improving workflow efficiency. Additionally, significant use cases included cleaning out "zombie" organizationsâ€”stale or unused entries cluttering the systemâ€”and simplifying the identification of duplicate organizations to ensure a clean and organized Zendesk instance.

## Features

- **Ticket Management**: Automate tasks such as ticket updates, bulk deletions, or assigning tickets to agents.
- **User Management**: Handle user creation, updates, or bulk operations.
- **Data Export**: Extract Zendesk data for reporting or analysis.
- **Data Import**: Push data from CSV files back into Zendesk for bulk updates or other operations.
- **Custom Automations**: Implement specific workflows tailored to your Zendesk instance.

## Prerequisites

Before using these scripts, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your machine.
- Access to your Zendesk API token and admin credentials.
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zendesk-automation-scripts.git
   cd zendesk-automation-scripts
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Zendesk credentials:

   ```env
   ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN=your_subdomain
   ZENDESK_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   ZENDESK_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
   ```

## Usage

Run any of the scripts in the repository by executing them from the command line. For example:

```bash
python bulk_delete_tickets.py
```

### Example Scripts
- **fetch_orgs.py**: Fetches all organizations in your Zendesk instance and saves the data into a CSV file, making it easy to manipulate in Excel or Google Sheets.
- **bulk\_delete\_tickets.py**: Deletes a batch of tickets based on certain criteria.
- **export\_tickets.py**: Extracts ticket data into a CSV file.
- **import\_data\_from\_csv.py**: Reads data from a CSV file and pushes updates back to Zendesk.
- **update\_ticket\_status.py**: Updates ticket statuses in bulk.

## Configuration

Modify the `config.json` file (if included) to customize the scripts' behavior, such as setting filters for tickets or defining specific fields to update.
